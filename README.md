### By: Claudia Vargas

## Welcome to my App
This is an app that intend to help people to plan trips. It allows you to save and organize the information needed to plan successfully a trip. You can find different fields to register the information and a map (in the future) to help you to choose the right place to go and the transportation available.

## Unsolved problems or major hurdles
- When I make a request I got options method display on the browse. To fix that problem I used Rack::Cors to make a proper cross domain AJAX calls.
